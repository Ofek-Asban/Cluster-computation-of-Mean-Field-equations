# Cluster-computation-of-Mean-Field-equations
Goal of the project and Background:
The goal of the project is to find the solution of the mean-field equation of electron glass and spin glass systems. This equations are highly non linear and consist of random parameters.
Electron glass system can be 
$'\frac{1}{2}'$
