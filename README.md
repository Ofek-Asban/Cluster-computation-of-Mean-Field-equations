# Cluster-computation-of-Mean-Field-equations
Goal of the project and Background:
The goal of the project is to find the solution of the mean-field equation of electron glass and spin glass systems. This equations are highly non linear and consist of random parameters.
Electron-Glass system is described in this link 
$$\frac{1}{2}$$
